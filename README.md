Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo and Noisy Likelihoods: A Review and some new suggestions : This report is a review of the paper Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo by Luigi Acerbi \cite{acerbi2018variational} and of further extension \cite{acerbi2020variational} of VBMC that addresses the limitations of the former paper by including noisy likelihoods. VBMC is an approximate inference method that combines Variational Inference with Bayesian Quadrature. We perform experiments as done in the original paper, compare with the benchmarks and provide our insights regarding them.
